# Unity-Mini-Project-2

Due to the fact that this repo is created on the date of the deadline, some of the work that was agreed upon
from the proposal was already done, some modeling, and all the animations. The remainder of the work that we would
have needed to find from the internet such as the external models will be added, intergrated and then pushed on the repo


Youssef Abuelleil: particle effects(VFX), lighting and 3 animations, transperency texture

Mahmoud Ahmed: 3 animations, chair model, created texture

Alie el deen: 3 animations, table model, main menu

Moustafa Sallam: 2 animations, house model, main menu



rest of the models will be imported
